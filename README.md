activeswap.jquery
=================

Automatically swap images for an '_active' version of the image on mouseover.


Usage:
------

When you want an image to change when you mouseover it, simply make two image files.

Name them the same, except add '_active' before the file extension.  

For example, you could have "home_link.png" and "home_link_active.png"

Add the attribute "data-activeswap=true' to the image tag on your website.

For example, <img src="images/home_link.png" data-activeswap="true" />


Hope you enjoy!
